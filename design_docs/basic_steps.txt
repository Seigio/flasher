KEY:
	* = to do
	- = done

Step 1:
	- Load a question from a json

Step 2:
	- update text whenever you press next
	- update the text based on a json file

Step 3:
	- have an input field, so you can answer questions displayed through the text
	- have each text possess a right answer
	- show feedback if you get the right answer

Step 4:
    - Refactor structure to work better with Flask
    - Refactor the templates into working with React.js
        - Instead of using an initializer to load in elements, and instead of using the update
          function within Pagination (Which doesn't fit with the concept behind the Pagination model),
          instead use React to load in data from the Json file
    - Implement Pagination

Step 5:
	* Have a better method of serving up the json files, maybe with SQLALCHEMY
	* Have a method for creating decks
	* Have a method of selecting decks and serving up multiple files
	* Have a way to preview available decks

Step 6:
	* Create a content management system so different users can log in and access different decks




Javascript design:
	Module for pages:
		list of flashcard indexes, clicking will load a goto and update the text
		hitting next will load a goto with the parameter of the current index + 1, index - 1 
        for previous

		Page Module should also include a checker, which calls the webserver with an evaluation 
        of the current answer plus the index number and the file name;

	Holding data from json:
		Json Data should be stored in a global object
